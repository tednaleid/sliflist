Fatebringer is a 140 RPM hand cannon, back in a reprised version from the Vault of Glass. In D2, it&amp;rsquo;s a kinetic (in D1 it was Arc). It drops in the Vault of Glass from Templar or Gatekeeper encounters. Once acquired, it will also drop from either of the two secret chests and can be acquired from the post-Atheon chest for Spoils of Conquest x 20.</description></item><item><title>Fatebringer (Timelost)</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/vog/fatebringer_timelost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/vog/fatebringer_timelost/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
This is the &amp;ldquo;Timelost&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;Adept&amp;rdquo;) version of this weapon, which drops only by completing the Conflux encounter Challenge in Vault of Glass on Master mode. The rolls here are the same as the normal version except with a higher drop chance because the Timelost version comes with double perks in the final two columns. The Adept version comes with static rolls in column 3 (Explosive Payload) and in column 4 (Firefly), both solid perks.</description></item><item><title>Vision of Confluence</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/vog/vision_of_confluence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/vog/vision_of_confluence/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
