This is the &amp;ldquo;Timelost&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;Adept&amp;rdquo;) version of this weapon, which drops only by completing the Conflux encounter Challenge in Vault of Glass on Master mode.

The Adept version comes with static rolls in column 3 (Explosive Payload) and in column 4 (Firefly), both solid perks.</description></item><item><title>Hezen Vengeance</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/vog/hezen_vengeance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/vog/hezen_vengeance/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
