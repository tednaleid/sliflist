Chroma Rush is one of the many beautiful new weapons available in S14. It&amp;rsquo;s a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart from Arctic Haze. See how they compare over on light.gg.

Farewell is a Lightweight frame, 360 RPM Sidearm introduced in S14. It&amp;rsquo;s the only Kinetic Lightweight available in the game, and the only other sidearm of that type entirely.
PvP Thoughts With the recent nerf to 120RPM HCs and Aggressive frame shotguns (well, all shotguns really), sidearms now have more of a chance to shine. Farewell has some of the amazing new perks on it.</description></item><item><title>Gridskipper</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/gridskipper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/gridskipper/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.

Highlights from the streamerati:
Ehroar &amp;ldquo;The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in the PvE meta for some time&amp;rdquo; Frostbolt &amp;ldquo;This thing is horrifying. It&amp;rsquo;s going to remind you of The Mountaintop It&amp;rsquo;s like a full-auto GL!&amp;quot; Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of PvE.</description></item><item><title>Shattered Cipher</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
The Cipher is a 900 RPM Machine Gun that arrived in Season 14. There are many excellent MGs in the pool right now, so this one has some tough competition. The Cipher has arguably has the least interesting set of perks to choose among.
