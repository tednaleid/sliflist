It&amp;rsquo;s a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart from Arctic Haze. See how they compare over on light.gg. Artic Haze suffered from a punishing base recoil and a lack of stability and damage-dealing perks whereas Chroma has both of those in spades.
PvP Thoughts AR&amp;rsquo;s were most recently meta a few seasons back when the 600 RPM variant dominated the Crucible.</description></item><item><title>Farewell</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/farewell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/farewell/</guid><description>Farewell is a Lightweight frame, 360 RPM Sidearm introduced in S14. It&amp;rsquo;s the only Kinetic Lightweight available in the game, and the only other sidearm of that type entirely.
PvP Thoughts With the recent nerf to 120RPM HCs and Aggressive frame shotguns (well, all shotguns really), sidearms now have more of a chance to shine. Farewell has some of the amazing new perks on it.

It&amp;rsquo;s the only 540 RPM Energy Pulse Rifle available at the moment and drops with all of the new seasonal perks. Definitely pick this up if you frequent the Crucible.
PvP Thoughts Gridskipper is a phenomenal PvP weapon and arguably the best weapon introduced in S14. Many folks have reviewed it; here are a handful of selections:
The feel of this gun is so very Destiny&amp;hellip; and so terribly well-balanced and is yet another reminder that Bungie is the best at fun gameplay, bar none.</description></item><item><title>Ignition Code</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/ignition_code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/ignition_code/</guid><description>The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in the PvE meta for some time&amp;quot; - Ehroar
This thing is horrifying. It&amp;rsquo;s going to remind you of The Mountaintop It&amp;rsquo;s like a full-auto GL! - Frostbolt
Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of PvE.</description></item><item><title>Shattered Cipher</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</guid><description>The Cipher is a 900 RPM Machine Gun that arrived in Season 14. There are many excellent MGs in the pool right now, so this one has some tough competition. The Cipher has arguably has the least interesting set of perks to choose among.
In the April 29, 2021 TWAB Bungie refers to MGs (reformatted):
Machine Guns are used for ammo-efficient add clear and secondary single target sustained damage. We expect to adjust Machine Guns in a future Season, they&amp;rsquo;re not currently hitting this target.</description></item><item><title>Sojourner's Tale</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/sojourners_tale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/14/sojourners_tale/</guid><description>Sojourner&amp;rsquo;s Tale is a Legendary Slug Shotgun in the Energy slot, introduced in S14.
PvP Thoughts From a PvP perspective, slug shotguns come in two flavours:
High Handling + Low Aim Assist: Sojourner's Tale, First In, Last Out Low Handling + High Aim Assist: Blasphemer, Heritage, Bonechiller If you love sniping Guardians with slug shotguns and wish you had a Legendary you could use in place of your Duality then you&amp;rsquo;re in luck!</description></item></channel></rss>
