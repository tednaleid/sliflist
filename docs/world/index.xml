It&amp;rsquo;s the first time it&amp;rsquo;s been available with random rolls. It&amp;rsquo;s a Rapid-Fire Frame with an interesting perk layout that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ultimately result in a lot of super interesting rolls.
PvE Thoughts All of the best perks are in the final column. There are OK perks in the third column but nothing that super synergizes moreso than the other GLs that can roll in this slot.</description></item><item><title>[Black Scorpion-4sr](https://www.light.gg/db/items/525750263)</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/black_scorpion_4sr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/black_scorpion_4sr/</guid><description>The Black Scorpion (now sunset) is Rapid-Fire Frame Scout Rifle in the Energy Slot. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a modern-day Rapid-Fire, check out the Trustee from Deep Stone Crypt.
PvP Thoughts CoolGuy&amp;rsquo;s review (8/2019) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive Breakdown Podcast Ep. 148. There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus.</description></item><item><title>[BrayTech Werewolf](https://www.light.gg/db/items/528834068)</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/braytech_werewolf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/braytech_werewolf/</guid><description>The BrayTech Werewolf is a 450 RPM &amp;ldquo;Precision Frame&amp;rdquo; Kinetic Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 8.

Sunsetting was introduced and then rolled back, 150 RPM HCs were collapsed into the 140 RPM frames and 110 RPMs were upgraded to 120 RPM, turning them into absolute PvP monsters. 140s are middle- of-the-pack but still pack a decent punch.
PvP Thoughts Once upon a time 120s rules the roost and 140s needed a bit of help.</description></item><item><title>[Eternity's Edge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2782325301)</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/eternitys_edge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/eternitys_edge/</guid><description>Eternity&amp;rsquo;s Edge is a Solar sword that was reissued as a Vortex Frame in Season 14.

It&amp;rsquo;s the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve seen this with random rolls, so it does have a contemporary set of perks available (e.g. Demoiltionist and Vorpal). With the S14 shotgun nerf, and the mid-2020 precision damage PvE buff for Shotguns, (quoted below) this one should be at the top of your list.</description></item><item><title>[Gnawing Hunger](https://www.light.gg/db/items/821154603)</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/gnawing_hunger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/world/gnawing_hunger/</guid><description>Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM &amp;ldquo;Adaptive Frame&amp;rdquo; Energy Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 6.

The base stats are terrific and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that any single roll is &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; per se, but there are certainly some rolls that are more desireable than others from a min/max&amp;rsquo;ers perspective.
PvP Thoughts If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, complete the catalyst! Completing it grants you the masterwork:
&amp;ldquo;Increased magazine size. Grants increased handling, reload and weapon range based on the number of stacks of Paracausal Charge.</description></item></channel></rss>
