You can pick it up from chests in the Battlegrounds playlists and Umbral Engrams. It features a handful of the new S13 perks including Impulse Amplifier, Frenzy and Lasting Impression. Ehroar put together a solid video review comparing them and offering some suggestions for interesting rolls. You&amp;rsquo;re going to be drowning in these by the end of Season 13 and with the new damage perks, these are worth picking up!</description></item><item><title>Extraordinary Rendition</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/13/extraordinary_rendition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/13/extraordinary_rendition/</guid><description>Extraordinary Rendition is a 750 RPM Kinetic Submachine Gun; part of the S13 weapon set. Both perks and stats are virtually identical to the Cold Front, available only during the 2020 Dawning, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to rely on the work we did there for these rolls 🎉🎉🎉 Ehroar covers the Extraordinary Rendition in depth.
The cornerstone of both PvE and PvP are Surplus. If you end up with a &amp;ldquo;PvE roll&amp;rdquo; that also happens to have super high Stability, then you&amp;rsquo;ve got the Holy Grail.</description></item><item><title>Imperial Needle</title><link>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/13/imperial_needle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/13/imperial_needle/</guid><description>The Needle is a Lightweight Frame, Void Bow, part of the S13 family of seasonal weapons. It can roll with many of the new perks including Frenzy and Impulse Amplifier. It&amp;rsquo;s otherwise quite similar to the Whispering Slab in terms of base stats.
As per usual, I suggest checking out these amazing posts:
A Bow Guide - /u/kfairns An In-Depth Guide to Using a Bow in Competitive PvP (Console or PC) - /u/TheGuiltySpark117 The new perks don&amp;rsquo;t change the suggested PvP rolls from Whispering Slab, so these rolls will be straight reproductions from what we previously covered when S11 dropped; Whispering Slab - S11.</description></item></channel></rss>
