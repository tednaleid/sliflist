In spite of playing Destiny for thousands of hours, I've never equipped a single `Elemental Well` mod. It took me probably a year to wrap my head around `Chared with Light` mods, and history has repeated itself yet again. It's now Season 15 and we have approximately thirty well mods. With more ways to generate wells and more and varied benefits than ever before, how about we dive in? Please see the Reference section below for a list of the resources this information was gathered from.

## Overview

Why bother with Wells at all? Shouldn't I just throw on some Ammo Finders and core stat buffs and call it a day? Sure, that's totally fine for the majority of content in Destiny. If you're pushing higher tier content while under-leveled (e.g. Grandmaster Nightfalls or Master Vault of Glass), you might be looking for more benefits at the cost of those of core armor mods.

Elemental Wells, which work by picking them up the same way you would an Orb of Power, come with two benefits. The first benefit is that you will always gain ability energy. Does the element of the well match your subclass?

* **YES** - Grants ~10% energy to *all* of your abilities.
* **NO** - Grants ~10% energy to your ability with the lowest energy.

The second benefit will be whatever unique bonus that particular mod confers.

## Example - Using your Fists

### Step 1 - What Benefit(s) Do You Want?

Let's say you're a Titan. You really love punching things and you want to do it MOAR. As it turns out, there's a mod precisely for you.

{{< gear-mod img-src="/images/well-of-striking.png" title="Well of Striking" desc="Picking up an Arc elemental well grants you additional melee energy. Multiple copies of this mod increase this effect.">}}

Not only does it give you melee energy, you can equip it on multiple armor pieces and get even more. Awesome, I've booted up a piece of Arc armor and equipped the `Well of Striking` mod. Now I need to pick up an {{%element-arc%}} well. Where do those come from?

### Step 2 - Generating Wells

As of Season 15, in general you can think about most well generation as tied to your subclass, because most well-maker mods require it. For example, if you want to generate {{%element-arc%}} wells, you'll need to be running an {{%element-arc%}} subclass. Of course this is Destiny so there are exceptions like the `Overcharge Wellmaker` mod, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader 📚🙃

You happen to love the `Arc Logic` Moon auto-rifle, and we're in luck! There's a mod that fits your playstyle:

{{< gear-mod img-src="/images/elemental-armaments.png" title="Elemental Armaments" desc="Weapon takedowns with a damage type that matches your subclass element have an escalating chance to spawn an elemental well.">}}

Now that you have that mod equipped and are running an Arc subclass, you'll be generating {{%element-arc%}} wells in no time. Pick up those wells and you'll be super punching everything in no time.

## DeMarko's Quick Reference

Words of wisdom from an experienced well-user:

> *{{%element-solar%}} builds are the easiest, as usual. {{%element-stasis%}} builds are interesting, but for Warlocks, a {{%element-void%}} build should get some mileage. You can mix and match of course, but you only have five slots.*

|Armor Element|Generation and Benefits|
|:-|:-|
|{{%element-arc%}}|Melee, melee damage, finishers, wells come to you
|{{%element-solar%}}|Explosions, grenades, and healing
|{{%element-stasis%}}|Stasis shards as wells, recharge ability with lowest energy, increase well ability timers, supers
|{{%element-void%}}|Class abilities, weapon final blows after class abilities, damage reduction

### Well Mods: Generating Wells

**Mod**|**Armor**|**Cost**|**Well Element**|**Requirement**|**Comments**
:-----|:-----|:-----:|:-----|:-----|:-----
**Bountiful Wells**|{{%element-solar%}}|2|{{%element-solar%}}|1 or more other well generating mods|Allows well generating mods to stack, but the best part is just having this mod equipped will _spawn an additional well to any other well generating mod_. ex: 1 Bountiful Wells + 1 Elemental Ordnance = 2 wells on grenade kills, add 1 Explosive Wellmaker and a single explosive grenade can generate _4 wells_.
**Elemental Armaments**|Any|2|Subclass|Weapon takedowns with a damage type that matches your subclass element.|~10% on PvE kill; stacks until a Well spawns. It takes around eight kills on average to spawn a Well.
**Elemental Light**|Any|1|Subclass|Super final blows.|Your Super needs to be able to damage enemies to generate Wells.
**Elemental Ordnance**|Any|3|Subclass|Grenade final blows.|Grenades can only spawn an Elemental Well once every couple of seconds. Any grenade that deals persistent damage over an area, such as a Vortex Grenade, works best with Elemental Ordnance. When paired with Elemental Charge, this gives your abilities a means of generating stacks of Charged with Light
**Explosive Wellmaker**|{{%element-solar%}}|3|{{%element-solar%}}|Rapid explosive damage final blows.|Applies broadly, basically anything that explodes save for Warmind Cells. Includes: Telesto bolts, Xenophage, Rocket/Grendade launchers, Reservoir Burst explosions, exploding thrall/supplicants/screebs, etc.
**Melee Wellmaker**|Any|4|Subclass|Melee final blows (powered).|
**Overcharge Wellmaker**|{{%element-arc%}}|4|{{%element-arc%}} x 2|Finisher final blows.|Due to how finishers place you next to enemies, you'll usually consume both Elemental Wells when the animation ends. Since finisher animations are rather lengthy, this mod indirectly bypasses the Elemental Well spawn cooldown, allowing you to spawn two Wells with every finisher.
**Reaping Wellmaker**|{{%element-void%}}|2|{{%element-void%}}|After activating your class ability, your next weapon final blow|Reaping Wellmaker's effect lasts until you either kill an enemy or you die.
**Shieldcrash Wellmaker**|Any|4|Shield's Element|Breaking a shield with the matching weapon type.|The Elemental Well is generated under the target that just had their shield destroyed. This mod pairs exceptionally well with Shield-Break Charge.

### Well Mods: Energy-Granting

The base effect of all Elemental Wells is to grant ability energy on pickup. The following mods cause Elemental Wells to grant **additional** energy.

* Each of these are stackable, meaning the more you have equipped, the greater the energy gain.
* Each of these requires you to pick up the matching elemental type. E.g. if the mod is {{%element-solar%}} you need to pick up a {{%element-solar%}} well.

**Mod**|**Armor**|**Cost**|**Effect On Well Pickup**
:-----|:-----|:-----:|:-----|:-----
**Well Of Striking**|{{%element-arc%}}|1|~6% melee energy / stack
**Well Of Ordnance**|{{%element-solar%}}|1|~6% grenade energy / stack
**Well of Restoration**|{{%element-stasis%}}|4|~6% energy for the ability that has the lowest energy / stack
**Well Of Utility**|{{%element-void%}}|1|~6% class ability energy / stack

With the addition of **Bountiful Wellmaker** (which spawns an extra well for every well generated), these mods tend to fell a bit underpowered (as of Season 15).
