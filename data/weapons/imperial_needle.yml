overview: >
  The Needle is a Lightweight Frame, Void Bow, part of the S13 family
  of seasonal weapons. It can roll with many of the new perks including
  `Frenzy` and `Impulse Amplifier`. It's otherwise
  [quite similar](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=DOPUeB;Moe3e)
  to the Whispering Slab in terms of base stats.
  
  
  As per usual, I suggest checking out these amazing posts:

  The new perks don't change the suggested PvP rolls from Whispering Slab,
  so these rolls will be straight reproductions from what we previously
  covered when S11 dropped;
