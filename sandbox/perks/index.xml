Bows The net result seems to be that you get more out of less draw time. I.e. it improves the results of all shots that are not perfect-draw, like an acceleration of the Draw Time window right up until perfect draw without actually improving the overall Draw Time.
Impulse Amplifier increases the &amp;ldquo;velocity&amp;rdquo;/travel-distance of partially-drawn shots, but the draw time on Lightweights is so low that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say how useful this is.</description></item><item><title>Killing Wind</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/perks/killing_wind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/perks/killing_wind/</guid><description>Check out CoolGuy&amp;rsquo;s review of Killing Wind.
Here&amp;rsquo;s are the benefits as he describes them:
Killing Wind has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the duration. It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits (strafe speed, etc.). It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff. The Range boost it provides &amp;ldquo;is like a sustained version of Opening Shot&amp;rdquo;. Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow speed.</description></item></channel></rss>
