It took me probably a year to wrap my head around Chared with Light mods, and history has repeated itself yet again. It&amp;rsquo;s now Season 15 and we have approximately thirty well mods. With more ways to generate wells and more and varied benefits than ever before, how about we dive in? Please see the Reference section below for a list of the resources this information was gathered from.</description></item><item><title>Holster</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/mods/holster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/sandbox/mods/holster/</guid><description>Season 15 added Holster Leg Mods for all weapon types that have more than one round in the chamber by default (i.e. no tube grenade launcher, rocket launcher, or sword mods).
The description says:
Gradually reloads your stowed &amp;lt;weapon_type&amp;gt; over time. Multiple copies of this perk stack to reduce the time taken to fully reload.
The various mods work similarly across weapon types, the only difference is the number of round loaded for each time the mod procs.</description></item></channel></rss>
