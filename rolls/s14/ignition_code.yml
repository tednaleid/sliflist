  overview: >
    You'll notice that we're looking to lower `Blast Radius` to ensure
    that we concentrate as much of the damage as possible on to the
    direct hit (v. splash). `Slideshot` is absolutely brilliant once you
    get the timing right. Check out some

    highlights.

  overview:
    Combining the new `Danger Zone` perk with `Blinding Grenades` means
    you're practically blinding an entire room each time you fire it.
    Absolutely top-tier for challenging PvE content. Without `Slideshot`
    you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful
    of variants are offered without it.

  overview:
    This roll is centered around the damage bosts from `Spike Grenades`
    and `Vorpal Weapon`. Again we're looking to minimize Blast Radius and
    keep the damage focused on the point of contact. Without `Slideshot`
    you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful
    of variants are offered without it.
