    The two new third-column perks `Heating Up` and `Tunnel Vision` are
    brilliant on the Gridskipper. I'm partial to `Heating Up` but people
    love them both. The roll wouldn't otherwise be different so I'm
    combining them here.

    Nice little pairing of two perks that play off of each other's
    benefits to ADS (`Moving Target` increases movement speed while
    ADS and `Snapshot` increases ADS speed).

    On Pulse Rifles, `Firmly Planted` is an acquired taste. I loved it on
    my Jian 7 paired with `Rangefinder`; amazing laser beam on long(er)
    sight lines.
