    We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so
    we can go for Stability-enhancing Barrel options. Wait, what the
    hell is `Elemental Capacitor` doing in there?! The Handling and
    Stability bonuses are material. The Stability bonus is the most
    noticeable, 
    [estimated](https://youtu.be/D_Mv-AdfYqM?t=36) to be around `20
    points`. You *absolutely* feel the difference with `Elemental
    Capacitor` active (don't forget to swap weapons if you're testing it)
    so I won't be relaxing it on these rolls. I think there's not much of
    a point to this SMG above other Energy weapons unless you can flex
    what makes it unique, and `Elemental Capacitor` certainly does that.

    Same as our initial set of rolls, pivoting around `Vorpal` if you
    love shredding supers in PvP, which we can all agree is Destiny's
    National Pasttime.

    Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred
    through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG
    but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you
    end up getting it to proc. I won't be relaxing either Vorpal or FTTC
    on these rolls because just one of either would mean that it's not
    worth using this over something else in the Energy slot.

    Good for generating Warmind Cells against hordes of enemies. Best for
    low and mid tier add clear.
